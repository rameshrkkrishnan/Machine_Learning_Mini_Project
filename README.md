Overview:
This project aims to predict the energy consumption of appliances by analyzing environmental and indoor factors. 
The task involves developing a machine learning model that leverages variables such as temperature, humidity, 
and weather conditions to forecast energy usage using a supervised regression approach.
Objective:
